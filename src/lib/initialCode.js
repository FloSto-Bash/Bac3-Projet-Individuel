Explanation
-----------
To run your code, click the 'Play' button on the right side of the screen 
(just like normal Python code). 

You must use the predefined 'compare' and 'swap' functions, or the animation 
will not work.

The list you need to sort is called 'myList', and you cannot redefine it.

You can only use specific built-in functions in your algorithm.  
If you think a built-in function is missing, please report it using the  
'Report an issue' button.

Allowed built-in functions
--------------------------
__import__, range, len, int, float, str, list, bool, min, max, all, any, abs, 
sum, round, reversed.

Predefined Functions
--------------------
compare(arr, i, j) -> bool
Returns True if arr[i] <= arr[j], otherwise False.

swap(arr, i, j)
Swaps the elements at indices i and j in arr.

Try the example code below to see how these functions work.
"""

# Make sure to enable the 'Show compare' checkbox to visualize comparisons
compare(myList, 0, 1)

# Make sure to enable the 'Show swap' checkbox to visualize swaps
swap(myList, 0, 1)`;
