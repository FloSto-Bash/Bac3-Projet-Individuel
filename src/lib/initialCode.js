Explanation
-----------

To run your code, click the 'play' button on the right side of the screen 
(just like normal Python code). 
You must use the predefined 'compare' and 'swap' functions, or the animation 
will not work.

The list you need to sort is called 'myList', and you cannot redefine it.

Predefined Functions
--------------------

compare(arr, i, j) -> bool
Returns True if arr[i] <= arr[j], otherwise False.

swap(arr, i, j)
Swaps the elements at indices i and j in arr.

Try the example code to see how these functions work.
"""
# Be sure to activate the check box 'Show compare' to see the output of the code
compare(myList, 0, 1)

# Be sure to activate the check box 'Show swap' to see the output of the code
swap(myList, 0, 1)
