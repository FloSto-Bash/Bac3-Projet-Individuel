For more information about the project, please refer to the [user-guide](./doc/sources/user-guide.md) and the [programmer-guide](./doc/sources/programmer-guide.md). The documentations are both available in PDF format, in the `doc/PDFs` folder. I personnally recommend to use the markdown version, with a markdown viewer (such as GitHub or VSCode) to benefit from a better navigation experience.

Be aware that some path to the files in the documentation are relative to the official repository and may not work in this one.

Enjoy your reading !
